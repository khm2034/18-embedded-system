# **Embedded Syetem Mini Project**
### Project Name : *AI Speaker In Car*
----------------------
## **1. Overview**
There are many AI speakers around us. I think that it is necessary to apply them to cars. But they rarely have devices that operate AI System. So, I think that Couldn't it be possible to put an artificial intelligence system in the vehicle speakers? so. I tried the project.

Two processes operate simultaneously.

1. Voice recognition
When you press the first button, the LED flashes, and speaker can recognize the sound. and then, when you type in the sound, a music is start. finally, press the last button, the music is stop, and state is initialize.
2. Accident avoidance
