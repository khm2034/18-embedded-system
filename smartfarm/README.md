# Smart Farm

## 1. Overview
The project name is Smart farm. it uses a particular module to measure temperature and brightness. when temperature and brightness is beyond a certain range, fan is ranning and red led is turned on. and All data that is monitored are sended from Raspberry Pi to the server every 10s.

## 2. Requiremnets
 - Monitor temperature and lightness on every 1ms.
 - Use an analogous data for a ligthness sensor. 
 - Build a server in cloud and install MySQL and Apache into it. 
 - Send sensor data from Raspberry Pi to the server every 10s. 
 - Turn on FAN when the temperature goes beyond 20 degrees (C)  for 5 second. 
 - Turn on LED when the lightness goes below 2500 and turn off it otherwise. 
 - Each functionality should be performed by an independant thread
 - Use a signal mechanism when threads need to communicate each other. 

## 2. Implementation
* ## monitoring thread  
    ![moni](./img/moni.jpg)  
    this thread is monitoring of sensor data. it monitor temperature and brightness on every 1ms. but It works differently in practice. because gettng the temperature data takes a long time.  
    So, if the temperature data that is monitered is greater than 25 degrees, send a signal to the fan thread that is asleep.
    Likewise, if the brightness data that is monitered is greater than 2500 degrees, send a signal to the led thread that is asleep.
    lastly 
* ## Detect temperature  
    This project uses DHT22 Module, Water pump Module 
    When temperature that is measured by DHT22 Module is over 22â„ƒ, water pump is operated 1 second. and then they are turned off.
    this process is repeated endlessly.
